c     Description
c
c     LIMEX  solves linearly-implicit  differential-algebraic  systems
c     (DAEs) of the form
c
c        B (t,y) * y' (t) = f (t,y).
c
c     If n is the size of the system, B is a (n,n)-matrix of rank less
c     or equal n. General  conditions for  the applicability  of LIMEX
c     are a regular  matrix pencil B + h A with A the Jacobian of  the
c     residual of the DAE and an index of the DAE less or equal 1. The
c     discretization  of LIMEX  is based  on the  elementary  linearly
c     implicit Euler discretization
c
c        ( B(t,y(k)) - h J ) ( y(k+1) - y(k) ) = h f(t(k+1),y(k))
c
c     where J is the (approximate) Jacobian of the residual
c
c         d              |
c        -- ( f - B y' ) |      .
c        dy              |t=t(0)
c
c     Combined  with  extrapolation  this one-step  method permits  an
c     adaptive control of stepsize and order. Within the extrapolation
c     process  one  computes  for  a  basic stepsize H  approximations
c     T(j,1) for y(t(0)+H) using  the discretization  above with step-
c     sizes  h(j) = H / j, j = 1, ..., j(max). Then the  extrapolation
c     tableau recursively defines higher order approximations T(j,k):
c
c                            T(j,k-1) - T(j-1,k-1)
c        T(j,k) = T(j,k-1) + ---------------------, k = 1, ..., j.
c                            j / ( j - k + 1 ) - 1
c
c     As error estimates the subdiagonal differences T(j,j) - T(j,j-1)
c     are taken.
c
c     The efficiency of LIMEX mainly depends on the performance of the
c     evaluation of the Jacobian  and in particular on the solution of
c     the  linear systems. Therefore  different versions  of LIMEX are
c     available with  different methods to create the  Jacobian and to
c     solve the linear systems.
c
c     Jacobian generation: numerical or analytical (user supplied)
c
c     Linear systems solvers: direct for dense matrices, LIMEX version
c     4.3A, direct or iterative methods (GMRES or BICGSTAB) for sparse
c     matrices, LIMEX version 4.3B. The  code  for dense  matrices de-
c     termines the optimal matrix representation, full or banded, from
c     the  ratio between  the system  size and the number of lower and
c     upper diagonals in the Jacobian.
c
c     Throughout  the code a local error control is implemented, which
c     requires that the  local error of a component y(i) is  less than
c     rTol * abs ( y(i) ) + aTol(i). This approach enables  to specify
c     more or less sensitive components of the solution vector.
c
c     The code has an additional option to compute  consistent initial
c     values (CIVs). For this  task an  extrapolated Newton  iteration
c     is used to  determine correct  start values at t = t(0) for  the
c     algebraic variables (which are known only  approximately in many
c     applications) and the derivatives  of the differential variables
c     (which are unknown in most applications), which  satisfy exactly
c     the  DAE. The algebraic  variables are these  components of  the
c     solution  vector, for  which  the  corresponding columns  in the
c     matrix B(t,y) contain zeros only. All other  components will  be
c     accounted  as  differential  variables,  whose  values  are  not
c     changed during the CIV computation. However, in many cases where
c     only the  right derivatives at  the start of the integration are
c     unknown, LIMEX solves the DAE even without CIV determination.
c
c     Furthermore a dense output option is availabe. With this  option
c     one may compute solutions of the DAE on a dense set of points in
c     the integration interval with nearly the same accuracy as at the
c     automatically  selected integration  points. The method bases on
c     Hermitian interpolation and considers all intermediate solutions
c     computed in  the extrapolation process. The dense  output option
c     may be combined with the  one-step mode, i.e. the return  to the
c     calling  program after  every  integration  step, and  also with
c     continuation  calls. These options  enable to obtain efficiently
c     solutions  on an  arbitrary user defined  set of values  for the
c     independent variable.
c
c     If information  about the  structure of the  Jacobian  matrix is
c     needed, the  matrix in a specific  integration step is available
c     in a PostScript plot.
c
c     Since in many  applications some components of the solution have
c     to be nonnegative, due to their physical interpretation, one may
c     set for these  components that only positive values ( => 0 ) are
c     allowed. If in the extrapolation negative values  are occurring,
c     the stepsize is reduced by a heuristic factor.

c
c     Installation notes:
c
c     Requires the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) library and
c     the LAPACK  library. Ideally, one  should  use  vendor-optimized
c     BLAS and LAPACK routines. If these are not available, one should
c     use the routines collected in source form in the file
c
c        'LIMEX4_3_Auxiliaries.f'
c
c     This  file is  part  of  the  LIMEX4_3A distribution. The  whole
c     Fortran BLAS and LAPACK libraries are  available from the netlib
c     repository  at http://cm.bell-labs.com/netlib/master/readme.html
c     or one of its mirrors.
c
c     This code is written almost  purely in ANSI Fortran 77 standard,
c     only the following non-standard features are used:
c
c        do ...  end do  constructions (without statement labels)
c
c        implicit none   to use only explicitly declared variables
c
c        include '....'  for inserting code
c
c        symbolic names may be longer than 6 characters
c
c        lower case and underscore characters used
c
c     All dimension statements in LIMEX  refer to the size definitions
c     in the include file 'LIMEX4_3_Size_Definitions.h'. This file has
c     to consist of four parameter statements of the following form:
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the  maximum number of  equations. This statement sets an
c     upper limit for the number of equations defining the DAE.
c
c     parameter ( Max_Nr_of_Equations    =
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the maximum number  of non-zero entries in the  Jacobian.
c     This statement defines an upper limit for the number of non-zero
c     entries  in  the  Jacobian of  the  residual  of  the  DAE. This
c     parameter is not used  in the LIMEX version 4.3A, it is included
c     here  only for consistency of the include files of the different
c     LIMEX versions.
c
c     parameter ( Max_Non_Zeros_Jacobian =
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the  maximum  number of non-zero entries in the left-hand
c     side matrix B.
c
c     parameter ( Max_Non_Zeros_B       =
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the  maximum number of  lower diagonals in  the Jacobian,
c     i.e. the lower  half-bandwith of  this matrix. The value of this
c     parameter  must  be  between 0 (no lower  diagonals) and n (full
c     lower triangular submatrix possible). The actual number of upper
c     diagonals is defined  in LIMEX by the control parameter Iopt(8).
c     This parameter is not used in the LIMEX version 4.3B.
c
c     parameter ( Max_Lower_Diagonals    =
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the  maximum number of  upper diagonals in  the Jacobian,
c     i.e. the upper  half-bandwith of  this matrix. The value of this
c     parameter  must  be  between 0 (no upper  diagonals) and n (full
c     upper triangular submatrix possible). The actual number of upper
c     diagonals is defined in LIMEX by the control  parameter Iopt(9).
c     This parameter is not used in the LIMEX version 4.3B.
c
c     parameter ( Max_Upper_Diagonals    =
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c
c     Define the maximum number of vectors which are  available within
c     GMRES or  BICGSTAB. For GMRES  this statement  implies  an upper
c     limit for the dimension of the Krylov  subspaces. This dimension
c     is  defined by  Iopt(20), see  below. GMRES  then requires  that
c     Max_It_Vectors => Iopt(20) + 4 (this  relation  is  checked). If
c     the Krylov subspace is exhausted without  attaining the required
c     accuracy, a  restart is done. Reasonable values for Iopt(20) are
c     in many cases 10 or 20, then Max_It_Vectors should  be set to 15
c     resp. 25. The greater  the dimension  of the Krylov subspace is,
c     the  faster GMRES  converges  (in theory), but  needs a  rapidly
c     increasing number of floating point  operations and is also less
c     stable. If  BICGSTAB is  used, Max_It_Vectors must be 6 at least
c     (this  condition is  checked). If  no iterative  method will  be
c     used, Max_It_Vectors may  be set equal 1. This parameter  is not
c     used in  the LIMEX version 4.3A, it  is included  here only  for
c     consistency  of   the  include  files  of  the  different  LIMEX
c     versions.

c
c     All restrictions  are  checked, but  no further  control of  the
c     consistency of the input data will be performed.
c
c     n          Integer variable, must be set by caller on entry, not
c                modified. Size of the  differential algebraic system.
c                Restriction: Max_Nr_of_Equations => n => 1.
c
c     Fcn        Name of an  external subroutine computing  the values
c                of  the  right-hand  side  function  f(t,y)  and  the
c                entries in the matrix B (see below).
c
c     Jacobian   Name of an  external subroutine computing  analytical
c                derivatives of the residual f(t,y) - B(t,y) * y' (see
c                below).
c
c     t_Begin    Real variable, must be set by caller on  entry. Inde-
c                pendent variable, starting point  of the integration.
c                On exit, the  value  of the  independent value, up to
c                LIMEX has solved the DAE successfully.
c
c     t_End      Real variable, must  be set  by caller on  entry, not
c                modified. Independent  variable, final  point  of the
c                integration.
c
c     y          Real  array  of  size  n, must  be set  by caller  on
c                entry. The  initial  values  of the  solution at  the
c                starting  point  t_Begin. On  exit,  y  contains  the
c                solution  at  the  final  point t_End, resp. at  this
c                value of the independent variable, up  to which LIMEX
c                has solved the DAE successfully.
c
c     ys         Real array of size n. Derivatives  of the solution at
c                t_Begin. Only the values  of ys for  the differential
c                variables  are needed. If the  values for ys are  not
c                known, set ys to  zero. If only estimates are  known,
c                these  should be  used. However, the  option  Iopt(6)
c                for the  computation of consistent initial values can
c                be used to  start always with  correct values for ys.
c                On exit, ys contains  the derivatives at t_End, resp.
c                at this  value  of  the  independent  variable, up to
c                LIMEX has solved the DAE successfully.
c
c     rTol       Real  array  of size 1 at least for Iopt(11) = 0 or n
c                for Iopt(11) = 1. Values  must be  set by  caller  on
c                entry,  not  modified.  Relative  error   tolerances,
c                interpreted as a scalar or a vector  depending on the
c                value of Iopt(11). The code keeps the local  error of
c                y(i)  below  rTol(i)*abs(y(i))+aTol(i).
c
c                Restriction: rTol(*) > 0.
c
c     aTol       Real array  of size 1 at least  for Iopt(11) = 0 or n
c                for  Iopt(11) = 1. Values  must be set by  caller  on
c                entry,  not  modified.  Absolute  error   tolerances,
c                interpreted as a scalar or a vector  depending on the
c                value of Iopt(11).
c
c                Restriction: aTol(*) => 0.
c
c                Remark: For any  component y(i), which could  be zero
c                during the integration  one has to set aTol(i) > 0 to
c                prevent  divisions  by  zero.  In  many  well  scaled
c                problems a reasonable setting is aTol(i) = rTol(i).
c
c     h          Real  variable, must  be  set  by  caller  on  entry.
c                Initial  stepsize  guess, if h  is  set  to zero, the
c                program puts  h = h_Min. This  variable is  currently
c                set  in a  parameter statement to 1.d0-4, but  may be
c                changed. On exit h is the  estimated optimal stepsize
c                for the next  integration step. If an  error occurred
c                h is set to zero.
c
c     Iopt       Integer  array  of  size 30, values  from  Iopt(1) to
c                Iopt(18) must be set by caller on  entry. Integration
c                control parameters.

c                         Restriction: 0 <= Iopt(1) <= 2.

c                Iopt(2)  The  unit  number  for  monitor  output, not
c                         modified. If Iopt(2) = 0, the  default value
c                         for the unit number is 6.
c
c                         Restriction: 0 <= Iopt(2) if Iopt(1) > 0.

c                         = 1 : matrix B is nonsingular
c                         For theoretical  reasons Iopt(5) = 0 reduces
c                         the  maximum  order  to 5, even  if  in most
c                         cases  LIMEX  also  runs  successfully  with

c                         the error.
c
c     Remark: In  addition to  these errors  LIMEX may  output on  the
c             current monitor unit the following warning messages:
c
c             1. Warning: component xxx does  not have  an  asymptotic
c                         expansion in the first integration step
c
c                This messsage  occurrs if for  some components of the
c                solution  no asymptotic expansion in  powers of h can
c                be found. The reason  for this can be either an index
c                of the DAE which is greater than 1 or (in most cases)
c                the lack of consistent initial  values. Thus, if this
c                message occurs  very frequently, the  computation  of
c                consistent initial  values by setting Iopt(6) = 1 may
c                prevent the  warning. However, in  many  cases  where
c                this  warning is  printed, the  integration  proceeds
c                without problems.
c
c             2. Warning: switch  to direct  solution of  higher order
c                         approximations
c
c                This warning  occurrs, if during  the integration the
c                higher order approximations can not be computed using
c                a Richardson iteration, if the direct solution of the
c                linear  systems is  selected. If an  iterative method
c                is  selected, this message  indicates that the higher
c                order  solutions can  not be obtained with  the first
c                order matrix ILU factorization as  preconditioner. In
c                both  cases, an appropriate  direct approach  will be
c                tried, but this can  be more time  consuming. If  the
c                problem is well posed, then this warning  indicates a
c                strongly varying matrix B(t,y). If the linear systems
c                are solved with direct methods, the maximum number of
c                iterations in the  Richardson  process  is defined by
c                the variable Max_Iter_Rich. The value of the limit is
c                defined in a parameter  statement and may  be changed
c                if necessary.

c
c     Fcn ( n, nz, t, y, f, b, ir, ic, FcnInfo )
c     ------------------------------------------
c
c     This subroutine  computes the right-hand side of the DAE and the
c     non-zero entries in the left-hand side matrix B(t,y).
c
c     Parameters:
c
c     n          Integer variable, size  of the DAE system, should not
c                be changed.
c
c     nz         Integer  variable, must  be  set  in the  subroutine.
c                Number of non-zero entries in the matrix B(t,y).
c
c     t          Real  variable, should not be  changed. Current value
c                of the independent variable.
c
c     y          Real array of size n, should not  be changed. Current
c                values of  the solution  vector, for  which f(t,y) is
c                required.
c
c     f          Real array of  size n, must be set in the subroutine.
c                Values of f(t,y) at the current values of t and y.
c
c     b          Real array of size nz, must be set in the subroutine.
c                Values of the non-zero entries in  the matrix B(t,y).
c
c     ir         Integer  array of  size nz, must  be set  in the sub-
c                routine. Row  indices of  the non-zero entries in the
c                matrix B(t,y).
c
c     ic         Integer  array of  size nz, must  be set  in the sub-
c                routine. Column  indices  of the  non-zero entries in
c                the matrix B(t,y).
c
c     FcnInfo    Integer variable. FcnInfo indicates  the type  of the
c                call  of Fcn. If FcnInfo = 0, the  call is  the first
c                call of  Fcn  in  the  current  integration  step. If
c                FcnInfo = 1 this  call is  within  the  extrapolation
c                process. FcnInfo = 2 indicates  a call of  Fcn within
c                the  numerical  evaluation of  the Jacobian. In  some
c                application  it may be  reasonable for efficiency, to
c                compute f and/or B during the numerical evaluation of
c                the Jacobian only with  limited accuracy. Furthermore
c                FcnInfo on return is  used as error  indicator. If an
c                error in the subroutine  Fcn occurs, set FcnInfo < 0.
c                Then LIMEX reduces the stepsize by the factor RedFcn.
c                This  variable   is  currently  set  in  a  parameter
c                statement  to 0.5, but  may  be  changed. If  such an
c                error  occurs during  the numerical evaluation of the
c                Jacobian, the program exits with an error message. If
c                no error occurs, set FcnInfo = 0.
c
c     Remarks:   The order  of the  entries in  matrix B is arbitrary.
c                If the indices  ir and ic are constant, they  must be
c                defined only once in the first call of Fcn.

c                JacInfo )
c                ---------
c
c     This  subroutine computes  the Jacobian  matrix, i.e. analytical
c     derivatives of the residual f(t,y) - B(t,y) * y'.
c
c     Parameters:
c
c     n          Integer variable, size  of the DAE system, should not
c                be changed.
c
c     t          Real  variable, should not be  changed. Current value
c                of the independent variable.
c
c     y          Real array of size n, should not  be changed. Current
c                values of  the solution  vector, for  which f(t,y) is
c                required.
c
c     ys         Real array of size n, should not  be changed. Current
c                values of the derivatives y'.
c
c     Jac        Real matrix of  dimension at least (LDJac,n), must be
c                set in the subroutine. The derivatives at the current
c                values of y, ys and t.
c
c     LDJac      Integer variable, the leading dimension of the matrix
c                Jac as declared in LIMEX, should not be changed.
c
c     ml         Integer  variable, the  number of  lower diagonals in
c                the Jacobian, should not be changed.
c
c     mu         Integer  variable, the  number of  upper diagonals in
c                the Jacobian, should not be changed.
c
c     Full_or_Band
c                Integer variable, should not be changed.
c                = 0 : Jacobian matrix is a full matrix.
c                = 1 : Jacobian matrix is a band matrix.
c
c     JacInfo    Integer variable, error indicator. If an error in the
c                subroutine  Jacobian  occurs,  set  JacInfo < 0. Then
c                LIMEX aborts with an error  message. If JacInfo => 0,
c                no error is assumed.
c
c     Remarks:   The general form of  this subroutine should look like
c                the  following  code  segment. This  works  for  both
c                matrix representations. The storage scheme for banded
c                matrices is the usual LINPACK/LAPACK format.
c
c                do j = 1, n
c
c                   iUpper = max ( 1, j - mu )
c                   iLower = min ( n, j + ml )
c
c                   if ( Full_or_Band .eq. 0 ) then
c                      k = 0
c                   else
c                      k = mu + 1 - j
c                   end if
c
c                   do i = iUpper, iLower
c
c                      Now define matrix element with indices i, j:
c
c                      Jac(i+k,j) = ...
c
c                   end do
c
c                end do
c
c                If the  numerical  approximation  of the  Jacobian is
c                used, one may supply a dummy routine. If the Jacobian
c                is a  sparse  matrix, it  can be  more  efficient, to
c                compute  the numerical approximation  of the Jacobian
c                also  by this  routine, even  if  for  such  problems
c                LIMEX4.3B should be preferable.
