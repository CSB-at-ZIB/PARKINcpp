     Overview of current versions:

     4.3A   Non-sparse dense  or  banded  Jacobians. Direct  solvers:
            LAPACK routines. Based on BLAS and LAPACK routines.

     4.3B   Sparse Jacobians. Direct  solvers: MA28 routines from the
            Harwell  library, iterative  solvers: GMRES and  BICGSTAB
            with  a variable ILU  preconditioner. Based  on BLAS  and
            LAPACK routines.

     Versions with other solver routines are available on request.

     The LIMEX 4.3A installation needs the following files:

     LIMEX4_3A.f               The main solver routine

     LIMEX4_3_Dense.f          Routines for Hermite interpolation

     LIMEX4_3_Auxiliaries.f    BLAS and  LAPACK routines used within
                               the  LIMEX  versions 4.3A  and  4.3B. 
                               This file is not  needed, if own BLAS
                               and LAPACK libraries are available.

     LIMEX4_3_Size_definitions.h 
                               Include  file, all  problem dependent 
                               dimension  statements in  LIMEX refer
                               to the  parameter definitions in this
                               file.

     Furthermore the distribution contains the sources of two sample
     applications:

     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Small.f 
                              A small example for the application of
                              LIMEX 4.3A with 3 equations.

     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Big.f  Larger  example for the application of
                              LIMEX 4.3A with 3531 equations.

     The output of these sample programs is included in the files:

     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Small-1.out (simple call, one step mode off, 
                                    no continuation)
     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Small-2.out (one step mode)
     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Small-3.out (continuation calls)

     LIMEX4_3A_Example_Big.out
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     To compile LIMEX 4.3A you  will first modify the makefile which
     is part  of the  distribution, to  your environment. Always use
     vendor optimized BLAS and LAPACK routines  when available. Then
     you  should be  able to run the test  examples and  compare the 
     output of your computations with the ouput  files in this LIMEX
     distribution. If no significant  differences  are recognizable,
     you have to write the following problem dependent subroutines:

     Fcn       computes  the right-hand side of the  DAE and the non
               zero entries in the left-hand side matrix.
     
     Only if analytical derivatives are desired:

     Jacobian  computes the Jacobian matrix.

     For more information about these subroutines, see the source of
     LIMEX4_3A.f.
