# This is a CMake makefile.  You can find the cmake utility and
# information about it at http://www.cmake.org
#
#
# This cmake file tries to find an installed BLAS and LAPACK libraries.  
# It looks for an installed copy of the Intel MKL library first and then
# attempts to find some other BLAS and LAPACK libraries.
#
#  blas_found        - True if BLAS is available
#  lapack_found      - True if LAPACK is available
#  blas_libraries    - link against these to use BLAS library 
#  lapack_libraries  - link against these to use LAPACK library 

# setting this makes CMake allow normal looking if else statements
