            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This is the exception thrown by the structural_svm_object_detection_problem
                when it detects that the image_scanner_type it is working with is incapable
                of representing the truth rectangles it has been asked to predict.  

                This kind of problem can happen when the overlap_tester_type indicates that
                two ground truth rectangles overlap and are therefore not allowed to both
                be output at the same time.  Or alternatively, if there are not enough
                detection templates to cover the variety of truth rectangle shapes.

                image_array_type must be an implementation of dlib/array/array_kernel_abstract.h

            WHAT THIS OBJECT REPRESENTS
                This object is a tool for learning the parameter vector needed to use
                a scan_image_pyramid object.  

                It learns the parameter vector by formulating the problem as a structural 
                SVM problem.  The general approach is similar to the method discussed in 
                Learning to Localize Objects with Structured Output Regression by 
                Matthew B. Blaschko and Christoph H. Lampert.  However, the method has 
                been extended to datasets with multiple, potentially overlapping, objects 
                per image and the measure of loss is different from what is described in 
                the paper.  

                In particular, the loss is measured as follows:
                    let FA == the number of false alarms produced by a labeling of an image.
                    let MT == the number of targets missed by a labeling of an image.  
                    Then the loss for a particular labeling is the quantity:
                        FA*get_loss_per_false_alarm() + MT*get_loss_per_missed_target()

                A detection is considered a false alarm if it doesn't match with any 
                of the ground truth rectangles or if it is a duplicate detection of a 
                truth rectangle.  Finally, for the purposes of calculating loss, a match 
                is determined using the following formula, rectangles A and B match 
                if and only if:
                    A.intersect(B).area()/(A+B).area() > get_match_eps()
